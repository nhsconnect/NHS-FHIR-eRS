{% include important.html content="This site is under active development by NHS Digital and is intended to provide all the technical resources you need to successfully develop the Service Search APIs." %}

# Introduction #

The eRS Service Search APIs within this site have been developed by NHS Digital. These APIs aim to better support the delivery of care by opening up information and data stored by the Electronic Referral Service (eRS).

# Application Programming Interface (API) #

A key aspect of the NHS e-RS vision is to enable local innovation and adoption of paperless referrals. You can do this in a secure and controlled manner using our API. The APIs are a well-defined interface aiding new software solutions in a simple way.
We want to stimulate and assist your development of applications linked to the NHS e-RS via its API. We describe and provide the usual tasks and support documents you will need here.


# Ecosystem #

The site has five main parts. Each aligns to a phase of development and partner engagement with NHS Digital, as shown below. The Communication Channels let you engage with each phase of the Ecosystem. They are enabling components.
