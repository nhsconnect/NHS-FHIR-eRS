# Introduction #

This specification provides information on the design and implementation of FHIR Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) within the NHS e-Referral Service (NHS e-RS). 
The FHIR&reg; APIs within this site have been developed by NHS Digital. These APIs aim to better support the delivery of care by opening up information and data stored by the Electronic Referral Service (eRS).

# Using this guide #

This guide has been created to support the adoption of the FHIR&reg; eRS API profiles and FHIR resources. As such the site is structured around stakeholders including API users, developers and architects, who have an interest in implementing the FHIRÂ® eRS API.

The specification is intended to be used alongside the published FHIR&reg; specifications:
- [FHIR DSTU2](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/)
- [STU3](http://hl7.org/fhir/)
